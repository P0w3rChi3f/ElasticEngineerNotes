Ethtool
A tool for modifying a network card. We want to turn of any kind of offloading or other things the card would normally do because we want to allow our tools to capture them in a raw format, by allowing the NIC to interact with the packets before we see them is not best practice.
```
ethtool -K eth1 tso off gro off lro off gso off rx off tx off sg off rxvlan off txvlan off  
ethtool -N eth1 rx-flow-hash udp4 sdfn
ethtool -N eth1 rx-flow-hash udp6 sdfn
ethtool -C eth1 adaptive-rx off
ethtool -C eth1 rx-usecs 1000
ethtool -G eth1 rx 4096  
```
Now the we ran this manually lets make it into a scrip incase we had multiple

```
#!/bin/bash

for var in $@
do 
    echo "turning off offloading on $var  
    thtool -K $var tso off gro off lro off gso off rx off tx off sg off rxvlan off txvlan off  
    ethtool -N $var rx-flow-hash udp4 sdfn
    ethtool -N $var rx-flow-hash udp6 sdfn
    ethtool -C $var adaptive-rx off
    ethtool -C $var rx-usecs 1000
    ethtool -G $var rx 4096
done
exit 0
