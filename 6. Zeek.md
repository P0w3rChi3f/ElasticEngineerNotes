# Zeek Install
Bro/Zeek is hosted in the Perched repo along with its dependencies and plugins.
New version - zeek, zeekctl, zeek-core, zeek-plugin-af_packet, zeek-plugin-kafka	//zeek-core & zeek-core are automatically installed dependencies

Old version - bro, broctl, bro-core, bro-plugin-af_packet, bro-plugin-kafka  
`sudo yum install zeek zeek-plugin-af_packet zeek-plugin-kafka`  

## Baseline configuration
Location of the config file depends on what RPM you installed from.  The packages maintain by ROCK are located in `/etc/zeek` as where most others place them under `/opt/zeek/etc`  

There are a few main config riles that need to be set in order for Bro/Zeek to function properly.  Here they are listed along with some of the fields that need to be considered:   

Used to tell bro/zeek about the local trusted IP space using CIDR notation 
Has private IP rnages by default
```
networks.cfg
```

zeekctl.cfg	~~broctl.cfg~~  
`Log-dir:` The directory bro/zeek writes its log to
`lb_ucstom.InterfacePrefix=af_packet::` Note: This line does not exist by default and needs to be added in order to tell bro/zeek to use af_packet  

A typical depylyment of Bro/Zeek is run on a singe sensor. Bro/Zeek is not mulitithreaded which means that each Bro/Zeek process needs to be assigned to a singl core and the total workload spread out amon mony cores. All of the process used by Bro/Zeek are clustered in what can be thought of as a single-node cluster. the luster is controlled by `broctl` which has an interactive shell mode as well as a list of commands than can be run directly in the command line.  **Note: Bro/Zeek can also be blusterd across more than on machine**  

`node.cfg`  
* __Mangager__ - the manager is a Bro/Zeek process that receives log messages and notices form the rest or the process in the cluster outputs a single log file for each log type
* __Proxy__ - the proxy is a Bro/Zeek process that syncronizes the cluster state and improves efficiency of the cluster by having the workers communicate with it rather than directly to each other.
* __Worker__ - The worker is the Bro/Zeek process that does protocol analysis on the network traffic. the bulk of the work done by the cluster is done by the workers and they typically make up the majority of the Bro/Zeek process in a cluster. **NOT: as a general guidline, allocate approximately 1 core for every 250 mbps of traffice being analyzed.**


## Change the locat of the log directory
```
sudo vi /etc/zeek/zeekctl.cfg
```
On line #67 change Logdir
```
LogDir = /data/zeek
```
Shift g - take to bottom of page and add
```
b_ucstom.InterfacePrefix=af_packet::
```
Save and Exit and create directory
```
mkdir /data/zeek
```  
gg - take you back up to the top of the page  

## Change Network Config (FYI)
```
vi /etc/zeek/networks.cfg
172.16.90.0/24 sg90
172.16.2.0/24 Instructor space
```


## Configure node.cfg
`vi /etc/zeek/node.cfg`  
`:set nu`   
Comment out lines 8-11  
uncomment lines 16-36  
`ctrl v` - visual block  
`ctrl x` - delete one character  
Add `pin_cpus=3` to line 23  

Starting line 29 - Create a worker
```
[interface-enp2s0]
type=worker
host=local
interface=enp2s0
lb_bethod=costum
lb_procs=2
pin_cpus=1,2
env_vars=fanout_id=93 
```
## Configure Local.Zeek

```
cd /usr/share/zeek/site
vi local.zeek

```
Uncomment  
```
@load policy/protocols/ssl/heartbleed  
@load policy/protocols/conn/vlan-logging  
@load policy/protocols/conn/mac-logging  
```
Add to local.zeek
```
load scripts/json
load scritps/afpacket
load scripts/kafka
```

## Crate a script to output Bro/Zeek
AF_Packet Zeek Plugin Script
```
cd /usr/share/zeek/site
